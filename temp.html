Currently, I'm honing my skills in SQL, Python, and Data Engineering, preparing
for my next big stepâ€”pursuing a Masterâ€™s at TU Hamburg. Beyond coding, youâ€™ll
find me hitting the gym, perfecting my nutrition, and learning German as I gear
up for an exciting journey ahead. I thrive on challenges, whether it's solving
complex data problems or pushing my personal limits. If you're looking for
someone who's driven, analytical, and always eager to learn, letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
